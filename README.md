# Shared polycube pipeline

![](synoptic.png)

The goal of this project is to unify multiple polycube-based hex-mesh generation algorithms with a straightforward syntax, hiding their specific command line interface. All input/ouput data is gathered in a shared data folder. 

Example:
```bash
# tetrahedralization of the B0 CAD model
./MeshGems ~/SharedData/B0 0.75 # max mesh size of 0.75

# labeling optimization with a Graph-cut algorithm
./graphcut_labeling ~/SharedData/B0/MeshGems_0.75 # default is compactness=1, fidelity=3

# hexahedral mesh extraction with libHexEx
./polycube_withHexEx ~/SharedData/B0/MeshGems_0.75/graphcut_1_3 3.0 # scale factor of 3
```

## `postprocess`

```txt
Hexahedral mesh quality improvement with pillowing and smoothing. Provided by the implementation of "Robust Quantization for Polycube-Maps", F. Protais et al. 2022

# Other programs

## `expand`

```txt
Expand a collection to its folder list
Usage:
  ./expand [OPTION...] <input>

  -h, --help        Print help
  -i, --input PATH  Path to the input collection
```

It also open expand nested collections, to list all the folders this collection includes.

## `custom_command`

```txt
./custom_command input_collection.txt command_to_execute [options]
```

For example:

```bash
# for each folder in the collection NETGEN_errors.txt,
# print the content of logs.txt
./custom_command ~/SharedData/NETGEN_errors.txt cat logs.txt

# for each folder in the collection MAMBO_CAD.txt,
# rename the file ending with .step by CAD.step
./custom_command ~/SharedData/MAMBO_CAD.txt mv *.step CAD.step
```

# Files

by alphabetical order

## Collections

= `.txt` files at the root of the data folder

A collection is a list of folders of same depth relative to the data folder. Collections can be used as input, and two collections are created/extended while an algorithm is runnning : one for the success cases, one for the error cases.

A collection can contain other collections.

Here is what a `MAMBO_Medium_NETGEN_0.75.txt` could look like :

```txt
# all Medium models meshed with NETGEN
# and a max mesh size of 0.75
M1/NETGEN_0.75/
M2/NETGEN_0.75/
M3/NETGEN_0.75/
M4/NETGEN_0.75/
M5/NETGEN_0.75/

## `hex_meshes_with_SJ.lua`

With the inverse parula colormap, a cell with a Scaled Jacobian of 1 is blue, and one with a Scaled Jacobian of 0 is yellow.

## `hex_mesh_with_SJ.geogram`

The same hexahedral mesh as `hex.mesh`, with the Scaled Jacobian as per-cell attribute. [Geogram](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/Mesh) format.

## `hex_postprocessed.mesh`

An hexahedral mesh in the MEDIT format after `postprocess` being applied

## `hex_postprocessed_with_SJ.geogram`

The same hexahedral mesh as `hex_postprocessed.mesh`, with the Scaled Jacobian as per-cell attribute. [Geogram](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/Mesh) format.

## `info.json`

A JSON file with information about:
- which algorithm generated this folder, its parameters and some comments (if comments were given)
- the date & time of execution
- Statistics of the output data
  * Number of vertices/cells for a tetrahedral mesh
  * Number of charts/boundaries/corners/etc for a labeling
  * Number of vertices/cells & min Scaled Jacobian for an hexahedral mesh

## `labeled_surface.geogram`

The same triangular mesh as `surface.obj`, with the `surface_labeling.txt` as per-face attribute. [Geogram](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/Mesh) format.

## `labeled_surface.lua`

A lua script for Graphite that loads `labeled_surface.geogram` with the right display settings.

## `labeling_init.txt`

An output file of `evolabel` containing the surface labeling of the initial individual (ancestor), `evolabel` being a genetic algorithm. This labeling is obtained with a graph-cut optimization.

## `labeling_stats.txt`

A intermediate output file generated by [`labeling_stats`](https://github.com/LIHPC-Computational-Geometry/genomesh/blob/main/apps/labeling_stats.cpp) of Genomesh. Most of its content is copied into `info.json`.

## `logs.json`

An output file of `evolabel` with labeling statistics, number of generations, timings, etc.

## `logs.txt`

A text file containing the STDOUT and STDERR printings.

## `polycuboid.mesh`

A intermediate output file generated by [`robustPolycube`](#robustpolycube). A deformed [`tetra.mesh`](#tetramesh) with an axis-aligned surface.

## `surface.obj`

A triangular mesh storing the surface/boundary of `tetra.mesh` in the Wavefront format.

## `surface_labeling.txt`

A text file with as many lines as faces in `surface.obj`, associating each face to a label.

label|direction
:---:|:-------:
0 | +X
1 | -X
2 | +Y
3 | -Y
4 | +Z
5 | -Z

## `surface_map.txt`

A text file with 2 more lines than the number of faces in `surface.obj` ( $nb_{triangles} + 2$ ), that maps the surface mesh to the volumetric `tetra.mesh`. The two first lines store the number of faces ( $nb_{triangles}$ ) and the number of tetrahedra ( $nb_{tetrahedra}$ ). The $nb_{triangles}$ remaining lines associate each triangle to the corresponding cell's facet of tetrahedron. The ordering of the facets is the one of [Ultimaille](https://github.com/ssloy/ultimaille) : 

facet number|tetrahedron vertices
:----------:|:------------------:
0 | {1,2,3}
1 | {0,3,2}
2 | {0,1,3}
3 | {0,2,1}

For example:

```txt
11486 triangles
51212 tetrahedra
186621
186405
35512
...
```

has $11486 + 2$ lines, and triangle $0$ (= $3^{rd}$ line) is the $3^{rd}$ facet of the $32985^{th}$ tetrahedron, because $186621 = 3 \times nb_{tetrahedra} + 32985$.

## `tetra.mesh`

A tetrahedral mesh in the MEDIT format

## `tetra_and_surface_mesh.lua`

A lua script for Graphite that loads `tetra.mesh` and `surface.obj` with the right display settings.

## `tetra_labeling.txt`

Same labeling as `surface_labeling.txt` but using per-tetrahedron-facet labels instead of per-surface-triangle labels. Therefore it contains $nb_{tetrahedra} \times 4$ lines. See `surface_map.txt` for the facets ordering.

label|direction
:---:|:-------:
-1 = no label| 
0 | +X
1 | -X

The reason for having 2 labeling files is that some hexahedral mesh extraction algorithms use the surface labeling, and other ones the volumetric labeling.

## `tetra_remesh.mesh`

A intermediate output file generated by [`robustPolycube`](#robustpolycube). A re-meshing of [`tetra.mesh`](#tetramesh).

## `tetra_remesh_labeling.txt`

A intermediate output file generated by [`robustPolycube`](#robustpolycube). A copy of [`tetra_labeling.txt`](#tetralabelingtxt).

## `turning_points.obj`

A Wavefront mesh containing only vertices, which are the turning-points of the labeling, i.e. points on a boundary where the direction changes.
